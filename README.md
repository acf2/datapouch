# Datapouch
Messy pile of data you didn't know you needed. Or you really didn't, how am I to know? CLI CRUD application constructor written in Lisp (with crutches while riding a bicycle, without SLIME/SLIMV (I know how dumb I am, don't bother)).
I must inform you that this is a _programmable_ notetaking software. That's it: if you don't want to program or want it EZ way - datapouch is not for you. I wanted an amalgam of orgmode and notion features, and tried to make it without GUI (because real GUI is too hard, and electron... let's not talk about *the shoggoth* here). Conclusion which I came to is that there is _too many_ features to implement. So in the end, all users must concern themselves with features they want in this thing, and implement these features themselves.

And yes, there is an endless mountain of the same apps. Name's Legion, but they all have a single fatal flaw: they *weren't written by me*. So no, *this* will be Ethay Eatgray Orkway of notetaking software. (And it better conclude my apprenticeship in The Programmers' Guild, for real this time)

If you stumbled upon this project while in need for some form of information management system, then I beg you: use something else - orgmode, logseq, roam, whatever. If you are determined to use *this particular project*, then I welcome you to read the code yourself. Readme is ill and absent. And that's okay, because I wrote this piece of lisp for myself and myself only.
