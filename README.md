# Datapouch
Messy pile of data you didn't know you needed. Or you really didn't, how am I to know? In Lisp. Written with crutches while riding a bicycle, without SLIME/SLIMV (I know how dumb I am, don't bother).

And yes, there is an endless mountain of the same apps. Name's Legion, but they all have a single fatal flaw: they *weren't written by me*. So no, *this* will be Ethay Eatgray Orkway of notetaking software. (And it better conclude my apprenticeship in The Programmers' Guild, for real this time)

If you stumbled upon this project while in need for some form of information management, then I beg you: use something else - orgmode, logseq, roam, whatever. If you are determined to use *this particular project*, then I welcome you to read the code yourself. Readme is ill and absent. And that's okay, because I wrote this for myself and myself only.
